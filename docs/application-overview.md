# Application Overview

This section aims to provide a high-level view of what components make up a
self-hosted ConstructHub instance, and troubleshooting guidance where
appropriate.

## High-Level Architecture

The frontend of ConstructHub instances is a single-page web-app (developed in
the [cdklabs/construct-hub-webapp] repository), served from an S3 bucket by a
CloudFront Web Distribution.

The CloudFront Web Distribution also serves objects from a second S3 bucket that
is used by the backend application to store indexed package data that is
presented by the fronted.

The backend of ConstructHub instances is an event-driven, serverless application
that performes the following tasks:

1. A *package source* implementation notifes the ConstructHub instance of new
   packages by sending messages to an ingestion SQS queue.
1. The *ingestion* function is triggered by the ingestion SQS queue, and
   verifies the new package version is compliant, before starting up the backend
   workflow.
1. The *backend workflow* is a StepFunctions State Machine that orchestrates the
   necessary steps to fully index a package into a ConstructHub instance.
1. The *prune* function enforces the configured deny-list and ensures previously
   indexed packages that are now part of the deny-list are removed from storage
   within an hour.
1. The *discovery canary*, if configured, is a Lambda function the will periodically validate the hub is able to discover new packages within a predefined SLA.

### 1. Package Sources

ConstructHub provides two package source implementations: `NpmJs` and
`CodeArtifact`.

* The `NpmJs` source interfaces with the `npmjs.com` CouchDB replica (which is
  at `replicate.npmjs.com/registry`) by following it's `_changes` stream in
  search of relevant packages. When such a package is identified, a stager
  function is invoked, which stages the package tarball into an S3 bucket then
  notifies the ConstructHub ingestion SQS queue. The CouchDB follower is
  scheduled to run every `5 minutes`, and stores the current CouchDB sequence ID
  in a specific object in the S3 bucket used for staging package tarballs.

  > Back-filling is automatic for the `NpmJs` source. Upon initial deployment,
  > it will start scanning the CouchDB `_changes` stream. Should there be a need
  > to re-run a backfill of this source, the transaction marker object in S3 can
  > be deleted to roll back to that initial transaction. The marker object is
  > linked from the backend dashboard.

  - A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the NpmJs Follower is not running at
    the scheduled cadence, or if it encounters failures for more than
    `15 minutes`.

  - A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the NpmJs Stager dead-letter queue is
    not empty.

  - Troubleshooting the NpmJs Follower can be done by inspecting its log traces
    in CloudWatch Logs, or by looking at service maps in the X-Ray console.

  - The NpmJs Follower produces a set of metrics that are automatically inserted
    in the *Backend Dashboard*, including the following:
    + `NpmJsChangeAge` shows how far behind the public `npmjs.com` registry the
      current CouchDB sequence ID is. In steady state (once the initial backfill
      has completed), this metric should always be below `5 minutes`.
    + `PackageVersionAge` is the amount of time elapsed between the publication
      of a package version in the public `npmjs.com` registry, and when that was
      signalled to the ingestion SQS queue. In steady state, this metric should
      always be below `5 minutes`.
    + `UnprocessableEntity` is the count of events received from the CouchDB
      instance that could not be processed. This metric is not emitted if no
      event was found unprocessable. The CloudWatch Logs for the NpmJs Follower
      will contain additional information about those events.

* The `CodeArtifact` source leverages EventBridge events emitted by any
  CodeArtifact repository when packages it contains are modified (created,
  updated, deleted). It considers only events pertaining to `npm` packages
  published the specific CodeArtifact Repository that it is configured with. A
  Lambda Function verifies the package version from the event is eligible for
  ConstructHub (i.e: it is a `jsii` package, using an allowed license, etc...)
  before staging it in an S3 bucket, then notifying the ingestion SQS Queue.

  > No backfill provision is currently implemented for the `CodeArtifact`
  > source. If a ConstructHub instance is started off from a pre-existing
  > CodeArtifact repository, the operator should manually inject all relevant
  > packages from said repository into the ingestion queue.
  >
  > :construction: A managed back-fill procedure will be provided in the future.

  - A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the CodeArtifact Forwarder function
    encounters failures.

  - Troubleshooting the CodeArtifact Forwarder can be done by inspecting its log
    traces in CloudWatch Logs, or by looking at service maps in the X-Ray
    console.

* Third party package-sources can also be used. Please refer to these sources'
  documentation for monitoring & troubleshooting guidance.

### 2. Ingestion

The *ingestion* process is implemented by a Lambda Function triggered directly
from the ingestion SQS queue. It performs the following steps:

1. Download the tarball from the S3 location indicated in the ingestion payload
1. Validate the input payload using the `integrity` checksum
1. Validate that it is eligible for indexing:
   - It contains a `.jsii` assembly document that is valid
   - It is released under an allowed license
   - Essential `.jsii` assembly corresponds to the `package.json` document
     - The package name must be identical
     - The package version must be identical
     - The license must be identical
   - The package version is not listed in the configured deny list
1. Attempt to identify a `LICENSE` file bundled in the package
1. Uploads the tarball to the package data S3 bucket
1. Creates the `manifest.json` object in the package data S3 bucket, containing:
   - The contents of the `LICENSE` file (if one was found)
   - The publication timestamp for the package version
1. Uploads the `.jsii` assembly to the package data S3 bucket as `assembly.json`
1. Triggers the *Backend Workflow* for the package version

A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the *ingestion* function encounters
failures, or if the ingestion SQS queue has messages older than `10 minutes`
approximately.

If the *ingestion* function fails for a particular queue message more than `5`
times, that message will be moved into a dead-letter queue. A **high-severity**
alarm triggers when the dead-letter queue is not empty.

Troubleshooting the *ingestion* function can be done by inspecting its log
traces in CloudWatch Logs, or by looking at service maps in the X-Ray console.
The function also produces several CloudWatch metrics that are visible in the
*Backend Dashboard*, including:
- `InvalidTarball` is the count of package versions that were rejected due to
  having an invalid tarball (missing the `package.json` file or `.jsii`
  assembly).
- `InvalidAssembly` is the count of package versions that were rejected due to
  containing an invalid `.jsii` assembly (in most cases, these are old packages
  that were built using a pre-1.0 release of `jsii` that is no longer supported)
- `MismatchedIdentityRejections` is the count of package versions that were
  rejected due to differences between data in the `.jsii` assembly and
  `package.json` files.
- `IneligibleLicense` is the count of package versions that were rejected due to
  using a license that is not in the configured license allow-list.
- `FoundLicenseFile` is the count of ingested package versions for which a
  `LICENSE` file could be identified.

### 3. Backend Workflow

The *Backend Workflow* is a StepFunctions State Machine that performs the
following tasks:

1. Execute the documentation rendering process for each supported language
   (TypeScript, Python, ...)
1. If any documentation could be rendered, adds the package version to the
   `catalog.json` object (which is a no-op if the package version is not the
   *latest* known release of it's major line)

When any step of the State Machine fails, a message is sent to a dead-letter
queue. That message includes information about the failure that happened (in
case multiple failures happened, only one cause will be represented), and
information about the State Machine execution (which can be used to review the
full execution log in the AWS Console, or using the StepFunctions API).

Executions that successfully sent a message to the dead-letter queue will show
as "success". Conversely, "failed" executions may not have a corresponding
message in the dead-letter queue and must be troubleshooted starting from the
failed execution instead.

A **high-severity** alarm trigegrs if the State Machine dead-letter queue is not
empty, or if any execution fails.

Troubleshooting can be done by reviewing State Machine execution events in the
StepFunctions console (or using the StepFunctions API), reviewing the log traces
of each step in CloudWAtch Logs, or by looking service maps in the X-Ray
console.

Messages from the dead-letter queue can be fed back to the State Machine by
using the "Redrive DLQ" Lambda Function, that is linked from the *Backend
Dashboard*.

### 4. Deny List Processes

Each ConstructHub instance can be configured with an optional set of deny-list
rules, to prevent packgaes from being indexed in that instance. If a package was
already indexed at the time it is added to the deny-list, all indexed assets for
it will be deleted by a *prune* Lambda Function.

A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the *prune* function does not run at the
configured cadence, or if it encounters failures.

Troubleshooting can be done by inspecting the log traces it produces in
CloudWatch Logs, or by looking at service maps in the X-Ray console.

The *prune* function emits a `Rules` CloudWatch Metric that indicates how many
deny-list rules it is currently enforcing. This could match the amount of rules
that were configured on the ConstructHub instance.

### 5. Discovery Canary

The [discovery canary](../README.md#discovery-canary) is an optional canary that
can be configured as part of the hub's deployment NpmJs package source. Its job
is to continuously validate that the hub is able to discover and process
packages in a timely manner.

The canary monitors the availability of new versions of a designated package
in the ConstructHub instance (by default, this is `construct-hub-probe`), and
emits metrics that help understand how much time elapses between the package
publication to npmjs.com (`construct-hub-probe` gets a new version approximately
every 3 hours), and when those packages are available to browse in ConstructHub.

A **high-severity** alarm triggers if the canary function is either
malfunctioning or detects discovery SLA breaches. Troubleshooting these alarms
is described in the operator runbook.

### 6. Feed Generation

Construct hub generates RSS/ATOM feed when the package catalog gets updated. The feed generator looks at the latest 100 packages and generates the feed. If the construct hub is configured to generate release notes, then the generated feed will contain the change log for the packages where it can be generated.


#### 6. Release Notes Fetcher

Construct hub can be configured to generate release notes for the packages that are added to the catalog. The release notes are generated from Github when the release information is available. The generation of release notes looks for the following places in Github
 - Get the release notes from individual release from Github
 - Get the list of all the releases from Github and then match the release number
 - Get the changelog.md file and match the release number to generate the release notes

Github APIs are rate-limited and for the construct hub to generate the release notes, it has to be configured with Github [Personal Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). The release notes generation process uses a step function to ensure that the rate limits are respected and will back up the request when the API service limits are hit


## Monitoring & Alarming

Each ConstructHub instance comes with a set of CloudWatch dashboards that can be
used to monitor the current state of the instance. The name of the backend
dashboard can be configured using the `backendDashboardName` property of the
`ConstructHub` construct:

```ts
import { App, Stack } from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { ConstructHub } from '@gd-constructs/construct-hub';

// The usual... you might have used `cdk init app` instead!
const app = new App();
const stack = new Stack(app, 'StackName', { /* ... */ });

// Now to business!
new ConstructHub(stack, 'ConstructHub', {
  backendDashboardName: 'ConstructHub-Backend'
});
```

This dashboard provides an overview of the most important process of the
ConstructHub instance, and can provide insight into the cause of many problem.

In addition to this, several alarms are automatically created by the
`ConstructHub` construct, that aim to inform operators about any problem. By
default no actions are configured on these alarms, but the `alarmActions`
property can be used to specify `IAlarmAction` instances to be bound to each
alarm:

```ts
import { SnsAction } from '@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch-actions';
import { Topic } from '@aws-cdk/aws-sns';
import { App, Stack } from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { ConstructHub } from '@gd-constructs/construct-hub';

// The usual... you might have used `cdk init app` instead!
const app = new App();
const stack = new Stack(app, 'StackName', { /* ... */ });

// Now to business!
const emergencyTopic = new Topic(stack, 'Emergencies', { /* ... */ });
const informationTopic = new Topic(stack, 'Information', { /* ... */ });

new ConstructHub(stack, 'ConstructHub', {
  alarmActions: {
    // This action triggers when immediate attention is needed!
    highSeverityAction: new SnsAction(emergencyTopic),
    // This action triggers with less urgent alarms.
    normalSeverityAction: new SnsAction(informationTopic),
  },
});
```
